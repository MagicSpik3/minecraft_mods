# **Mark's Minecraft Tweaks**

A collection of simple, vanilla-friendly data packs and resource packs for Minecraft: Java Edition. These packs are designed to add new functionality and improve quality of life without requiring complex mods.

## **Mods Included**

* **TameableBees:** A data pack that allows you to tame bees, turning them into loyal, stinging companions that won't die after attacking.  
* **BrightDiamonds:** A resource pack that makes diamond ore and deepslate diamond ore much easier to spot while caving.  
* **BlueBees:** A simple resource pack that re-textures bees to be blue.

## **Installation**

These packs are installed differently depending on their type (Data Pack vs. Resource Pack).

### **For Resource Packs (BrightDiamonds, BlueBees)**

1. Download or clone the resource pack folder (e.g., BrightDiamonds).  
2. Open Minecraft.  
3. Go to Options... \> Resource Packs....  
4. Click Open Pack Folder. This will open the .minecraft/resourcepacks folder.  
5. Drag and drop the entire BrightDiamonds or BlueBees folder into this resourcepacks folder.  
6. Back in Minecraft, the pack should now appear in the "Available" column. Click the arrow to move it to "Selected".

### **For Data Packs (TameableBees)**

Data packs are installed on a per-world basis.

1. Download or clone the data pack folder (TameableBees).  
2. Find your Minecraft saves folder (usually in .minecraft/saves).  
3. Open the folder for the world you want to add the data pack to.  
4. Inside that world's folder, open the datapacks folder.  
5. Drag and drop the entire TameableBees folder into the datapacks folder.  
6. If the world is already running, type /reload in the chat. If you are creating a new world, you can add the data pack from the "Data Packs" menu during world creation.

## **Compatibility**

These packs are designed and tested for **Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21+**.  
They may work on other versions, but you might need to change the pack\_format number inside the pack.mcmeta file to match your version of Minecraft.

## **Mod Details**

### **TameableBees (Data Pack)**

This data pack overhauls bee behaviour, making them loyal companions similar to wolves.  
**Features:**

* **Tameable:** Right-click a bee with any flower for a chance to tame it. Hearts will appear when successful.  
* **Follow Owner:** Tamed bees will follow you.  
* **Attack Hostiles:** Your bees will attack any mob that you attack, or any mob that attacks you.  
* **Sit/Stay:** Right-click your tamed bee with an empty hand to make it sit and stay.  
* **Immortal Sting:** Your bees no longer die after stinging a target.

### **BrightDiamonds (Resource Pack)**

This is a quality-of-life texture pack for miners.  
**Features:**

* **High-Visibility Ores:** Both diamond\_ore.png and deepslate\_diamond\_ore.png have been edited to have a bright, high-contrast outline, making them stand out in dark caves.  
* **Optional Emissive Textures:** For players using mods like **OptiFine** or **Sodium+Iris**, this pack includes emissive textures (\_e.png files). This makes the diamond veins themselves glow in the dark, making them impossible to miss.

### **BlueBees (Resource Pack)**

A simple cosmetic change for bee lovers.  
**Features:**

* Re-textures the default bee mob to have blue stripes and features instead of yellow.
